# Snake Game (Python)

## About the Game:
This is a small snake game developed using Python. If the snake collides with its own body, the game is over, and a new game starts automatically.

## Modules Used:
- **Turtle module:** Mainly used for creating the snake in this project.
- **Random module:** Used for generating food on the canvas.

## Note:
- The game runs only when all three files are in the same folder.
- The text file named 'snakescore.txt' dynamically stores the snake score, but it needs to be initialized with 0 initially.
- Designed for a 640 x 640 canvas.

## File Details:
- **sankegame2:** The main file with instructions to run the snake game.
- **snake2:** Contains the classes needed to run the game; these classes are imported into the main file.
- **snakescore:** A text file that contains score details, including the all-time high score.

Make sure all three files are in the same folder before running the game.

Feel free to adjust the formatting based on your preferences or any additional details you'd like to include.
